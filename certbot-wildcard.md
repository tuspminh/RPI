>Snap Support
>The Certbot snap supports the x86_64, ARMv7, and ARMv8 architectures. While we strongly recommend that most users install Certbot through the snap, you can find alternate installation instructions here.

# 1.Check if your DNS provider is supported
See if your DNS provider is supported by Certbot by checking this list in our documentation.

[check if your DNS provider supports Certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html#dns-plugins)

Not supported?
If your DNS provider is not supported, pause here: run Certbot with the manual plugin by using these steps from our documentation.

Supported?
If your DNS provider is supported, continue with the remaining instructions below.

# 2. SSH into the server
SSH into the server running your HTTP website as a user with sudo privileges.

# 3. Install snapd
You'll need to install snapd and make sure you follow any instructions to enable classic snap support.
Follow these instructions on snapcraft's site to install snapd.

[install snapd](https://snapcraft.io/docs/installing-snapd/)

# 4. Ensure that your version of snapd is up to date
Execute the following instructions on the command line on the machine to ensure that you have the latest version of snapd.
```
sudo snap install core; sudo snap refresh core
```
# 5. Remove certbot-auto and any Certbot OS packages
If you have any Certbot packages installed using an OS package manager like apt, dnf, or yum, you should remove them before installing the Certbot snap to ensure that when you run the command certbot the snap is used rather than the installation from your OS package manager. The exact command to do this depends on your OS, but common examples are sudo apt-get remove certbot, sudo dnf remove certbot, or sudo yum remove certbot.

If you previously used Certbot through the certbot-auto script, you should also remove its installation by following the instructions here.

# 6. Install Certbot
Run this command on the command line on the machine to install Certbot.
```
sudo snap install --classic certbot
```
# 7. Prepare the Certbot command
Execute the following instruction on the command line on the machine to ensure that the certbot command can be run.
```
sudo ln -s /snap/bin/certbot /usr/bin/certbot
```
# 8. Confirm plugin containment level
Run this command on the command line on the machine to acknowledge that the installed plugin will have the same classic containment as the Certbot snap.
```
sudo snap set certbot trust-plugin-with-root=ok
```
If you encounter issues with running Certbot, you may need to follow this step, then the "Install correct DNS plugin" step, again.

# 9. Install correct DNS plugin
Run the following command, replacing <PLUGIN> with the name of your DNS provider.
  
```
sudo snap install certbot-dns-<PLUGIN>
```
  
For example, if your DNS provider is Cloudflare, you'd run the following command:
  
```
sudo snap install certbot-dns-cloudflare
```
  
# 10. Set up credentials
You'll need to set up DNS credentials.
Follow the steps in the "Credentials" section for your DNS provider to access or create the appropriate credential configuration file. Find credentials instructions for your DNS provider by clicking the DNS plugin's name on the Documentation list.

# 11. Choose how you'd like to run Certbot
Either get and install your certificates...
Run one of the commands in the "Examples" section of the instructions for your DNS provider, along with the flag -i apache.

Or, just get a certificate
Run one of the commands in the "Examples" section of the instructions for your DNS provider.

# 12. Test automatic renewal
The Certbot packages on your system come with a cron job or systemd timer that will renew your certificates automatically before they expire. You will not need to run Certbot again, unless you change your configuration. You can test automatic renewal for your certificates by running this command:
```
sudo certbot renew --dry-run
```
The command to renew certbot is installed in one of the following locations:
```
/etc/crontab/
/etc/cron.*/*
systemctl list-timers
```
